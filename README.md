# Sturing_Manuplation
The most_frequent_word function takes a sentence as input and returns the most frequently occurring word, ignoring punctuation and case. In case of a tie, it returns the word that appears first. The function lowercases the sentence, removes punctuation, counts word frequencies using a dictionary, and resolves ties based on word order.
